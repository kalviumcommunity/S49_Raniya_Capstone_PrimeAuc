# E-Auctioning Platform

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly E-Auctioning platform that facilitates online auctions for various items, providing a seamless experience for buyers and sellers. The platform will enable users to list items for auction, place bids, and conduct transactions securely and efficiently.

## Tech Stack

The project will be built using the MERN stack, which includes:

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing auction items, user information, and transaction data.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework for building robust and scalable APIs.
- **React**: Frontend library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.


## Features

### User Authentication and Authorization
1. **User Registration**: Allow users to sign up for an account on the platform.
2. **User Login**: Enable users to log in securely to access their account.

### Listing and Managing Auction Items
3. **Item Listing**: Allow sellers to create listings for items they want to auction, including images, descriptions, and starting bid prices.
4. **Auction Management**: Enable sellers to manage their active auctions, including modifying item details, setting reserve prices, and closing auctions.
5. **Scheduled Auctions**: Provide the ability to schedule auctions to start and end at specific times.

### Bidding and Auction Interaction
6. **Place Bids**: Allow registered users to place bids on active auction items.
7. **Bid Notifications**: Notify bidders when they have been outbid or when an auction they are interested in is ending soon.
8. **Automatic Bidding**: Implement automatic bidding (proxy bidding) where users can set a maximum bid, and the system automatically increases their bid incrementally to maintain their position as the highest bidder.

### Payment and Transaction Management
9. **Secure Payment Gateway Integration**: Integrate with a secure payment gateway to facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers.
10. **Transaction History**: Provide users with a history of their past transactions, including purchases and sales.

These features will provide a solid foundation for your E-Auctioning platform, offering a comprehensive and user-friendly experience for both buyers and sellers.
